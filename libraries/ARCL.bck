$CMP 6_PIN_SERIAL_TARGET
D 6-pin header connection for use with the "FTDI BASIC" pinout - TARGET SIDE.  Also known as "Arduino Serial Program Header".  It is used to mate with our FTDI Basic serial programmers using the Arduino IDE.  <b>Note, this device has "TARGET" in the name.</b> It is intended to be used on a design that contains a target micro-controller that you wish to program.  <b>The "sister" device, named "CABLE"</b> is inteneded to be used on a design that usually lives on the end of your USB cable and prvides the converter chip (FTDI232 or FTDI231x) to commnicate serial RX/TX. <b>You can populate with some of these:</b><a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/116"> Break Away Headers - Straight</a> (PRT-00116)  For reference (or to suit your programming needs) check out these designs:<ul><li><a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9716"> SparkFun FTDI Basic Breakout - 5V</a> (DEV-09716)</li><li><a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9873"> SparkFun FTDI Basic Breakout - 3.3V</a> (DEV-09873)</li><li><a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12935"> SparkFun FTDI SmartBasic</a> (DEV-12935)</li><li><a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13746"> SparkFun Beefy 3 - FTDI Basic Breakout</a> (DEV-13746)</li></ul>

$CMP RELAY-SPDT-JQX-15F
D SPDT Electromechanical Relay Single-pole, double-throw sealed relays. When current is applied to the coil, it throws a simple changeover switch, terminating the connection from the NC contact to ground and closing the NO contact. Use them to switch high voltage/high current devices. <h4>SparkFun Products</h4><ul><li>JQX-15F: <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10924">Relay SPDT Sealed - 20A</a> (COM-10924)</li><li>JZC-11F: <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/100">Relay SPDT Sealed</a> (COM-00100)</li></ul>
